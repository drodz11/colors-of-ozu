## Intro


_"The unexpected humanity of the Ozu film is made possible by the rigor of its construction.
In an Ozu film...one sees all the supports, and all of them are equally essential"_
- Donald Richie, _Ozu: His Life and Films_ (1974, University of California Press)

_"No longer should we be bound to cinema as truth that exists only in a fleeting 24 frames-per-second.
We instead should make as many frames as we like, and hold them in our hands for as long as we want"_
- Kevin L. Ferguson, [Volumetric Cinema](http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2015/03/10/volumetric-cinema) (2015)

Begun as a research project in March of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, _Colors of Ozu_ is an on-going film analysis project that leverages digital tools and technologies to novelly and creatively examine the final six films of Japanese filmmaker [Yasujirō Ozu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasujir%C5%8D_Ozu). These works--which include _Equinox Flower_ (1958), _Good Morning_ (1959), _Floating Weeds_ (1959), _Late Autumn_ (1960), _The End of Summer_ (1961), and _An Autumn Afternoon_ (1962)--are also unique in their oeuvre for being the only films the prolific director and screenwriter even produced in color. While nearly all of Ozu's films have been widely regarded and studied for their distinctive visual style, relationship to Japanese society and culture, and other aesthetic and narrative qualities, little critical attention has been given to investigating Ozu's use of color at the end of his career. _Colors of Ozu_ seeks a dual purpose in adding this element to the existing, broad field of criticism around Ozu's work and applying the tools and methods of digital humanities (DH) research to strengthen the bond between DH and film/media studies.

The hope of this project is to inspire media scholars to explore research methods beyond traditional audio-visual analysis and DH practitioners to expand their purview into new cultural heritage domains by applying digital scholarship methods to the study of filmic texts. Further, the collection hosted on this website will reflect both the scholarly outputs of the investigation into Ozu's color films and provide guidance and instructions for those wishing to create their own digital scholarship project using the open-source tools leveraged here.

## Critical and Theoretical Contexts

#### _AV in DH_
As discussed by Susan Hockey in their 2004 chapter "The History of Humanities Computing," the field of DH has tended to put textual sources at "center stage" within the development of the discipline. Using computers to analyze and generate new knowledge about/from textual corpora--either by employing "distant viewing," annotation, or otherwise uniquely digital or computational techniques--has been a mainstay of the field since its earliest incarnations in the mid-20th century. It is only relatively recently that technology with the capacity to run similar computational analysis on moving-images or other visual cultural materials has become accessible to scholars and artists.

Beginning in the early 2000s with Lev Manovich's groundbreaking work in [Cultural Analytics](http://lab.culturalanalytics.info/) and reflected in other projects such as Frederic Brodbeck's [Cinemetrics](http://cinemetrics.fredericbrodbeck.de/), we have seen a slow rise in this subject area within DH. Scott Weingart's analysis of submissions to the [ADHO Conference](http://adho.org/conference) between 2015-2017 is helpful in quantifying this trend, as the findings shows an uptick from roughly 2% to 9% for submissions within the "film and media studies" subject area, while the "audio, visual, and multimedia" topic jumped from roughly 9% to 13%. While this observational data from one international conference does not necessarily signal a sea change in digital scholarship, it does suggest a growing facet of the field that deeply and meaningfully interrogates visual culture, cinematic history, and the massively proliferating network of digital images which surrounds contemporary life.
<br>
#### _Deformative vs. Deformed Humanities & Digital Surrealism_
The lens of "deformative criticism" is useful for conceptualizing digital scholarship within film & media studies and offers multiple, interdisciplinary inroads to this evolving field. First coined in their essay on poetics, "Deformance and Interpretation," by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann in 1999, a deformative approach to literary criticism rejects traditional "reflexive works of analysis" in favor of "responsive works of imagination."  These works (or "performative events"), such as reading a poem backwards or removing all the words except for certain parts of speech, "release or expose the poem's possibilities of meaning" that would be inaccessible via other forms of close-reading or discursive criticism. Mark Sample succinctly summarizes the value of such an exercise: "Reading backwards revitalizes a text, revealing its constructedness, its seams, edges, and working parts." What seems truly valuable and revolutionary about deformative criticism is this notion of cracking open a text (or image, or motion-picture, or .wav file) in a manner similar to disassembling a radio or other appliance to see how it works. It is possible to learn more about the object through breaking it down to its constituent parts and laying them out in different contexts and configurations than to study it as a finished, whole thing. This scholarly process is exploratory, creative, and ripe for insight and the generation of new knowledge.

But Sample also argues that this method is constricted by its insistence on "de-forming only to re-form." In "breaking" a text through a deformative action, the goal still remains to understand the text as an intact, complete thing in its original form. Rather than remain tethered to this interpretive confinement, Sample suggests a Deformed Humanities approach in which there is no need "to go back to the original text with a revitalized perspective, but to make an entirely new text or artifact" out of its wreckage. In other words, to circuit bend the radio into a new sonic tool rather than reassemble it back to working order, to spawn new texts, artifacts, images, sounds, and meanings than attempt to uphold their original content, structure, or materiality. Artist and media scholar Hito Steyrl, in their seminal essay "Is the Internet Dead?", situates "deformative" practices as part and parcel to the current media landscape wherein digital sounds and images act as "nodes of energy and matter that migrate...proliferate, transform, and activate...morph across different bodies and carriers, acquiring more and more glitches and bruises along the way." The Deformed Humanities approach operates on similar energy, wherein interpretation is enacted as "doing and knowing, [p]recisely because it relies on undoing and unknowing."

For the purposes of examining the works of Ozu, and for film & media studies more generally, there is a middle course to be walked between deformative and deformed practices that leverages the strengths of both. The work of Kevin L. Ferguson in the field they have called "digital surrealism" provides excellent examples of this sort of hybridized scholarly/creative methodology that has greatly informed this project. Like the surrealist practices first developed in the early 20th century, digital surrealism "follows in the formal tradition of surrealism by favoring automatic methods and pursuing these in a controlled, systematic way with the purpose to uncover knowledge not immediately perceptible by the rational mind" (Ferguson, 2016, p. 274). This is achieved by first "slicing" a filmic text (evoking the iconic eye-slice in Buñuel surrealist film [_Un Chien Andalou_](http://www.openculture.com/2014/05/watch-a-restored-version-of-luis-bunuel-salvador-dalis-surreal-film-un-chien-aldalou-1929.html)) "into something wholly new as an object of investigation" (ibid, p. 275) in order to "generate new analytical modes for digital humanists who work with image analysis [and raise] new, comparative, second-order questions that come out of this digitally-aided abstraction" (Ferguson, 2017). How and what issues ought to be considered when slicing up a film for digital transformation and interrogation are treated below as is further discussion of digital surrealist methods as a research methodology.

#### _The Films & Legacy of Yasujirō Ozu_
In Wim Wenders' documentary _Tokyo-Ga_ (1985), a film searching for what is left of the the now-canonical images of Japanese life found in Ozu's films in 1980s Tokyo, the German director succinctly and reverently characterizes Ozu's work as "a sacred treasure of the cinema." It is true that few auteurs have received the level of critical attention as Ozu, whose name resides in the pantheon of cinematic history and whose more well-known work (namely, 1949's _Late Spring_ and 1953's _Tokyo Story_) [often make lists claiming to define the "greatest films ever made."](https://www.bfi.org.uk/greatest-films-all-time) While it is outside the scope of this project to defend or challenge this standing and, far more importantly, to critically investigate the processes, motivations, and ramifications of these kinds of lists emanating from cultural heritage institutions in the [Global North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide), it is worth acknowledging this fact of Ozu's legacy simply for the sake of contextualizing this current project within a broader, developed field of study. The sheer amount of scholarship around Ozu's films provides many useful starting points for our analysis, and while a comprehensive literature review is (again) outside the scope of this project, a few key texts and critical points should be mentioned in the interest of framing the forthcoming analysis within this scholarly discourse.

A great deal of the commentary and criticism about Ozu's films have focused on the stylistic or formal qualities of the director's work. Over the course of his career, these features are often written about as solidifying into a distinctive set of strategies related to shot composition, editing style, and camera movement/placement. Adam Bingham helpfully lists these features of Ozu's "mature (post-1949)" period, some of which include:

  * The use of 360-degree shooting space
  * A predominately static camera
  * Low camera height
  * Camera placed in front of characters in dialogue
  * Symmetrical editing and presentation of space (47-48)

It is worth noting that, for the six color films treated in this study, the "predominately static camera" became an entirely static one, as these films do not contain any pans, tilts, or tracking shots.

For those who may not be familiar with Ozu's work, watching the films released during this "mature" period does induce a kind of déjà vu wherein plots, characters, and familial structures sometimes blur and run together. As noted by Donald Richie, Ozu had "but one major subject, the Japanese family, and but one major theme, its dissolution" (1). While there has been some resistance to this monolithic viewing of Ozu's films, notably from David Bordwell who contends that "closely scrutinized, his films turn out to be far less alike than people usually think" (2), considering that Ozu repeatedly employed the same actors to play many similar, key roles in his films (most famously, [Setsuko Hara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setsuko_Hara) and [Chishū Ryū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chish%C5%AB_Ry%C5%AB)), rigorously adhered to specific shooting and editing conventions, and released his films with titles that often employ similar evocations of temporal seasons (e.g. _Late Spring_ (1949), _Early Summer_ (1951), _Early Spring_ (1956), _Late Autumn_ (1960), _The End of Summer_ (1961), _An Autumn Afternoon_ (1962)), the casual or non-academic viewer might be excused in forgetting the specific details of these family-centered dramas that usually revolve around generational tensions between parents and children. This narrative and stylistic consistency present in Ozu's work, far from being a shortcoming, is a deep pronouncement and dedication to craft which is "formal and the formality is that of poetry, the creation of an ordered context that destroys habit and familiarity, returning to each word, to each image, in its original freshness and urgency" (Richie, xiii).

Using the digital tools and methods outlined in the next section, this project hopes produce a similar freshness and new way of looking at Ozu's cinematic poetry, one that breaks from the confines of traditional viewing and allows for new analytical methods.

Much more detailed and comprehensive analyses of Ozu's films can be found in many other places. For some recommendations of where to seek out these commentaries, see the Resources and Learning Tools section at the bottom of this page.

## Methods & Tools
Tools and applications used in this project include:

  * [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
  * [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)
    * [ImagePlot macro](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html) developed by the [Software Studies Initiative](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/)

These tools are all free and open-source. FFmpeg perhaps carries the steeper learning curve in that its use requires familiarity with the command-line and knowledge of FFmpeg structure and syntax. Alternatively, ImageJ, a GUI-based image analysis application developed by the National Institute of Health, has a multitude of functionalities, options, and settings which may not be immediately intuitive to novice users. Information and resources related to using these tools can be found in the "Resources & Learning Tools" section at the bottom of this page.

#### _Extracting a series of stills or "slices" from a digital video file_
As described by both Sample and Ferguson, one way of beginning the process of visually analyzing a motion-picture is convert the time-based media into a series of still images that can be more malleably manipulated by image analysis software. A number of methods exist for performing this task. As Ferguson describes, the Export feature built into the Quicktime Media Player (native to Mac OSX) can accomplish this in a fairly straightforward way. Similarly, Mark Sample's ["Sample Reality"](https://www.samplereality.com/) blog provides helpful [step-by-step instructions](https://www.samplereality.com/2017/11/15/image-analysis/) for the same procedure using the VLC media player.

The method I will provide here uses an FFmpeg command to create a series of still images. The benefits of this method are two-fold: 1) it does not rely on access to proprietary, platform-specific software, and 2) unlike the VLC method--which requires a video file be played back in real time--the FFmpeg command will extract stills at a regular interval over any duration in a fraction of the time. Additionally, the FFmpeg method allows for more control over the image output with regard to maintaining important formal characteristics like the aspect ratio.

The following command, modified from an [example provided on the FFmpeg Wiki](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Create%20a%20thumbnail%20image%20every%20X%20seconds%20of%20the%20video) after [consulting with the good folks who run the FFmpeg Twitter account](https://twitter.com/clavilux_of_FL/status/1239969705575636993), was used to create the stills:

```bash
ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -vf fps=0.5,"scale=iw*sar:ih,setsar=1" directory/outputname_%04d.png
```

This command consists of four key parts:

  * `ffmpeg` = calls ffmpeg to start the command
  * `-i inputvideo.mp4` = specifies the input file (in practice this would be the actual name of the video file)
  * `-vf fps=0.5,"scale=iw*sar:ih,setsar=1"` = this "video filter" (`-vf`) samples 1 frame for every 2 seconds of video and scales the output to square pixels (see below for an explanation of why this is an important modification)
  * `directory/outputname_%04d.png` = specifies the directory for the stills to be saved, a sequential naming convention (outputname_0001, outputname_0002, and so on), and file format for the stills (this can, alternatively, be `.jpeg` or another file-type)

After running this command, the output directory will become populated with still images, sequentially numbered and running the length of the video file (for a feature-length film, this will be 2,000-4,000 image files).

Let's see what happens when we execute this script on _An Autumn Afternoon_ (1962). Executed as written above, the outputted stills will look like this:

{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll006" %}

If, however, we run the command without the `"scale"` option, our stills will look like this:

{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll007" %}


Notice how this second image looks "squished" or "stretched" in comparison to the first. This distortion is caused by the non-square aspect ratio of the pixels in the source video. These need to be re-encoded to square aspect ratio in the stills using the `"scale"` modification. This, in turn, renders the full image in the proper 1.37:1 "Academy" aspect ratio (note that _pixel_ and _image_ aspect ratios are two related, but different, features of a digital image). While the question of pixel or image aspect ratio may seem like a small technical detail, I make a point of this because, for the purposes of analyzing the formal and expressive characteristics of Ozu's work, it is important that our captured data (or [capta](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html), as Johanna Drucker reminds us) align as closely as possible to the films' construction. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Ozu never made feature films using popular widescreen cinematography first introduced in the early 1950s. As accounted by David Bordwell, he is [quoted](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/04/07/a-matter-of-scope/) saying that the widescreen frame of CinemaScope reminded him of a roll of toilet paper. He remained committed to the canvas of the Academy aspect ratio throughout his career making sound films. As such, this is one instance where opting to not "deform" one feature of the original object of study works in favor of our critical project as it helps to minimize the introduction of other unintended or unwanted artifacts into our dataset. As described above, these sorts of decisions are in service of walking a middle course between deformative and deformed approaches wherein new, stand-alone works can be created that still have value in their capacity to help us "read" the original work and gain new insight.

For more information on the often very confusing issues related to pixel aspect ratio, see the "Resources & Learning Tools" section.

Now that we have converted our digital video files into still images, we can leverage the functionalities of ImageJ to critically investigate Ozu's uses of color.

<br>

## Analysis   
The Montage feature of ImageJ perhaps produces the most straightforward and familiar transformation and re-presention of a filmic text. While this method retains the original chronological order of a film's images (read top-to-bottom, left-to-right), it does "spatialize time" in presenting this chronology as a two-dimensional field which can be scanned and interrogated in ways a traditional viewing would not allow (even with the advent of digital scrubbing, slow-motion replay, etc.) (Ferguson, 2017, p. 278). We are able to observe a given moment in a unique context to others in the film, similar to viewing different features and details on geographic map and understanding their relationships to each other and the whole of the map's construction. With respect to color, we can also glean a strong chromatic impression from having the visual palette of the film laid out in a single image. Below are montages created for all six films treated in this project, presented in chronological order:

{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll013" %}
<br>
{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll015" %}
<br>
{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll009" %}
<br>
{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll016" %}
<br>
{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll014" %}
<br>
{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll010" %}

We can also leverage other tools, such as digital video, to structure our interrogation of these montages in order to generate new ways of "viewing" the film. In the example below, the center spatial point of the montage for _An Autumn Afternoon_ is used as our starting point. By slowly zooming out from the "heart" of the film, new pieces of visual information are gradually revealed as our field of vision becomes larger in scope. Evoking a structuring device similar to that used by Charles and Ray Eames' in their seminal educational film [_Powers of Ten_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0) (1972), this process of revealing and contextualization (albeit far less cosmic and profound than the Eames' subject matter) offers a spatialized method of viewing that not only unbinds the film from its temporal construction but also allows for a reinvigorated approach to seeing how color operates in the film.
<br>
{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll012" %}

### Summed Frame Z-Projections
The summed frame z-projection is a cornerstone of the "digital surrealist" method as described by Ferguson (2017). The images below were created using the "Stacks" functionality in ImageJ, wherein the extracted still images from a digital video file, or "slices," are digitally "stacked" together in order to represent the visual field of the entire film within a single frame. In doing this we "[convert] the dimension of time that we experience while watching a two-dimensional motion picture into a third spatial dimension that can also be analyzed." The documentation of ImageJ also references this conversion of a temporal dimension into the spatial one: "in stacks, a pixel (which represents 2D image data in a bitmap image) becomes a voxel (volumetric pixel), i.e., an intensity value on a regular grid in a three dimensional space" (Ferreira and Rasband, 2010–2012, p. 12).

While there are several projection-types offered in ImageJ, the "Sum Slices" option "adds together the voxel space of the stack of slices, compressing the film’s visual field to reveal a single representative image." This single representative image is a kind of "impression" or aggregation of the visual experience of the film itself distilled from its duration. Ferguson qualifies this representative image by noting that "[w]hile collapsing the film text to a single frame might initially strike some as overly reductive, this process magnifies a cinematic experience that is otherwise entirely unnoticeable: the pure, cumulative effect of duration on our eyes and brains" that isn't legible through regular ways of viewing tethered to a temporal experience of the film.

Below are the summed z-projections of Ozu's six color films in chronological order:

{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll003" %}
<br>
{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll011" %}
<br>
{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll008" %}
<br>
{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll005" %}
<br>
{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll004" %}
<br>
{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="coll002" %}

The first thing anyone is likely to notice between these images is their remarkable similarity of composition. All six z-projections have a ghostly human-esque shape at their center. Dark hair, the shape of a face, and something resembling shoulders and a torso are easily discernible, as is some semblance of clothing--a faint exposure of a tie can even be seen in both _Equinox Flower_ and _An Autumn Afternoon_, both films with middle-aged salarymen struggling with generational differences at their centers. One possible reading of these images is that they illustrate the rigorous conventions of Ozu's style as enumerated by Bingham and many others. This extends even to Ozu himself who self-characterized as "strictly a tofu dealer," referring to his repeated uses of actors, plots, and cinematographic techniques in his filmmaking (Richie, p. 10).  But tofu dealer or no, these images provide us with more insight than may initially meet the eye.
